## Part 1 of 3 - Local, non-persisted list of books

A convoluted method of building the app which involved using several different props which remained unused as they were passed down along child components. 


## Part 2 of 3 - Using an API to store existing data

Made requests to a JSON database to store data created inside the web application. Used other features to update and delete the data in the JSON file to reflect changes inside the web application.
